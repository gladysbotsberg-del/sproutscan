## Domain Check Process

**Need to verify:**
- .com availability
- .co and .app as backups
- App Store search (no conflicts)
- Trademark search (USPTO)
- Social handles (Instagram, TikTok)

I'll run these checks and update with availability.

## My Recommendation

**Top 3 to research:**

1. **BellyCheck** — Clearest, most memorable, instant understanding
2. **SafeBite** — Broadest appeal, room to grow
3. **BumpScan** — Good balance of fun and function

**Let's verify availability before falling in love with any name.**

## Brand Voice Guidelines

| Attribute | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Trustworthy** | Cite sources, never fear-monger |
| **Warm** | Like a knowledgeable friend, not a doctor |
| **Clear** | No jargon, plain English |
| **Empowering** | "Here's what you need to know" not "you should worry" |
| **Modern** | Clean design, not clinical or outdated |

### Example Copy:

**Fear-mongering (NOT us):**
> "WARNING: This product contains dangerous chemicals that could harm your baby!"

**Our voice:**
> "This contains aspartame. Research is mixed — FDA says it's safe in moderation, but some OBs recommend limiting. Here's what you should know..."

## Logo Direction

| Style | Fit |
|-------|-----|
| Minimalist | ✅ Yes — clean, modern |
| Playful/cartoon | ⚠️ Maybe — not too cutesy |
| Medical/clinical | ❌ No — too cold |
| Overly feminine | ❌ No — feels patronizing |

**Colors to consider:**
- Soft green (safety, health, calm)
- Warm neutral (trust, warmth)
- Avoid: Stark red (alarm), bright pink (patronizing)
