# 🍼 MamaSense

## Project Status: ACTIVE
**Name:** MamaSense
**Started:** February 7, 2026
**Goal:** Build the definitive pregnancy-safe ingredient scanner app

## Vision
Give expecting mothers instant, ingredient-level safety information — filtered through pregnancy, trimester, and breastfeeding contexts. Not "clean vs dirty." Just truth, context, and peace of mind.

## Philosophy
- Explain WHY, not just WHAT
- Context over scores
- Inform, don't fear-monger
- "Safe for this stage of life" > "clean eating"

## Strategic Expansion Path
1. Pregnancy (MVP)
2. Breastfeeding
3. Baby food scanning
4. Toddler nutrition
5. General "Why Is This Here?" scanner
