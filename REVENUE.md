# Revenue Model & Projections
## Pregnancy-Safe Scanner

---

## Pricing Models Considered

### Model A: Freemium Subscription (RECOMMENDED)

| Tier | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Free** | $0 | 10 scans/month, basic safety rating |
| **Premium Monthly** | $7.99/mo | Unlimited scans, full explanations, history, offline mode |
| **Premium Annual** | $59.99/yr | Same as monthly, ~2 months free |

**Why this works:**
- Low barrier to try (free tier)
- 10 scans is enough to see value, not enough for power users
- Pregnant women are highly motivated to pay for peace of mind
- Subscription captures full pregnancy journey (9 months)

---

### Model B: One-Time Purchase

| Option | Price |
|--------|-------|
| **Lifetime Access** | $29.99 |

**Pros:** Higher conversion, no subscription fatigue
**Cons:** No recurring revenue, harder to build predictable business

---

### Model C: Hybrid

| Tier | Price |
|------|-------|
| Free | $0 (limited) |
| Monthly | $7.99/mo |
| Lifetime | $49.99 one-time |

**Consideration:** Offer both, let users choose.

---

## Recommended: Model A (Freemium Subscription)

Reasoning:
1. Pregnancy is a defined period (~9 months) — subscription captures it
2. Recurring revenue enables sustainable business
3. Can add breastfeeding tier to extend lifetime
4. Industry standard for health/wellness apps

## App Store Economics

### Apple's Cut

- 15% after first year (Small Business Program if under $1M)
- 15% for annual subscriptions over 1 year

### Google's Cut
- 15% for first $1M in revenue
- 30% after

### Net Revenue Example
| Gross MRR | Apple's Cut (15-30%) | Net MRR |
|-----------|---------------------|---------|
| $10,000 | $1,500-3,000 | $7,000-8,500 |

**Plan for ~25% platform fees in projections.**

## Key Metrics to Track

| Metric | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **MRR** | Core business health |
| **Conversion rate** | Free → Paid efficiency |
| **CAC** | Cost to acquire customer |
| **LTV** | Lifetime value of customer |
| **Churn** | Monthly subscriber loss |
| **DAU/MAU** | Engagement ratio |
| **Scans per user** | Core usage metric |

### Target Ratios
- LTV:CAC > 3:1 (healthy)
- Conversion rate > 5% (good for freemium)
- DAU/MAU > 20% (engaged user base)

---

## Financial Summary

| Metric | Conservative | Optimistic |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| Year 1 Revenue | $65,000 | $200,000 |
| Year 1 Ending MRR | $14,000 | $48,000 |
| Break-even | Month 3-4 | Month 2 |
| Year 2 Revenue (projected) | $200,000 | $600,000+ |

**Bottom line:** This can be a real business. Not a lottery ticket — a grindable, buildable company.

| Launch (Month 3) | $500-1,000 | First revenue |
| Growth (Months 4-12) | $2,000-5,000 | $65-200K revenue |
