## Target Audience

### Primary: Pregnant Women (First-Time Moms)
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Age | 25-38 |
| Stage | Actively pregnant, especially 1st trimester |
| Mindset | Anxious, overwhelmed, wants to "do it right" |
| Behavior | Researches everything, reads labels, asks Facebook groups |
| Willingness to pay | HIGH — peace of mind is priceless |

### Secondary: Trying to Conceive (TTC)
- Already thinking about what to avoid
- Wants to "clean up" diet before pregnancy
- Converts to pregnant user (long customer lifetime)

### Tertiary: Breastfeeding Moms
- Similar concerns, different rules
- Natural expansion after v1.0

## Positioning

### The Problem We Solve
> "I'm pregnant and I don't know if this food is safe. Google gives me 10 conflicting answers. My doctor says 'just eat healthy.' I need a real answer NOW."

### Our Position
> "The only app that tells you if specific ingredients are safe for YOUR trimester — with honest explanations, not fear-mongering."

### Key Messages
1. **Scan → Know in 5 seconds**
2. **Trimester-specific** (not generic pregnancy advice)
3. **Explains WHY** (not just good/bad scores)
4. **Made by real people** (not a faceless corporation)

## Channel Strategy

### Phase 1: Organic / Community (Weeks 1-8)

| Channel | Tactic | Cost |
|---------|--------|------|
| **Reddit** | Helpful posts in r/pregnant, r/BabyBumps, r/January2027Bumpers etc. | Free |
| **Facebook Groups** | Join pregnancy groups, be genuinely helpful, mention app when relevant | Free |
| **TikTok** | Short videos: "I scanned 10 pregnancy snacks" | Free |
| **Instagram Reels** | Same content, different platform | Free |
| **Product Hunt** | Launch day post | Free |
| **Hacker News** | "Show HN" post about building it | Free |

**Goal:** 500-1,000 users from organic channels before spending money.

### Phase 2: Paid + Partnerships (Post-Launch)

## Launch Plan

### Pre-Launch (2 weeks before)
- [ ] Landing page with email capture
- [ ] "Join the waitlist" messaging
- [ ] Teaser content on social media
- [ ] Reach out to 10-20 mom bloggers/influencers
- [ ] Schedule Product Hunt launch

### Launch Week
| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Monday | Soft launch PWA to waitlist |
| Tuesday | Gather immediate feedback, fix critical bugs |
| Wednesday | Product Hunt launch |
| Thursday | Reddit/Facebook push (genuine, not spammy) |
| Friday | TikTok video series starts |
| Weekend | Monitor, respond to every review/comment |

### Post-Launch (Weeks 1-4)
- Daily social content
- Respond to EVERY review (App Store, social)
- Weekly iteration based on feedback
- Reach out to press (pregnancy blogs, health sites)

---

## Viral Mechanics

### Built-In Shareability
1. **Scan results are shareable** — "Look what I found in this 'healthy' snack"
2. **Controversy drives discussion** — "Is this really safe??"
3. **Comparison content** — "I scanned 10 protein bars for pregnancy"
4. **Before/after** — "I used to eat this every day..."

### Word of Mouth Triggers
- Pregnant women talk to other pregnant women constantly
- Facebook group recommendations spread fast
- "My friend showed me this app" is the goal

---

## Pricing Strategy

### Freemium Model
| Tier | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Free** | $0 | 10 scans/month, basic results |
| **Premium** | $7.99/mo | Unlimited scans, full explanations, history |
| **Annual** | $59.99/yr | Same as Premium, 2 months free |

### Why This Works
- Free tier gets users in the door
- 10 scans/month is enough to see value
- Pregnant women will pay for unlimited — too important not to
- Pregnancy is ~9 months — annual plan captures full journey

### Alternative: One-Time Purchase
| Option | Price |
|--------|-------|
| Lifetime access | $29.99 |

**Consideration:** Might be better for conversion ("pay once, done"), but loses recurring revenue. Test both.

## Competitive Response

**When competitors notice us:**
1. Stay focused on pregnancy (don't dilute)
2. Double down on "why" explanations (hard to copy quickly)
3. Build community/trust (moat)
4. Consider acquisition offers seriously

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Slow initial growth | Patience + organic grind. Don't panic-spend on ads. |
| Bad reviews early | Respond personally, fix fast, ask happy users to review |
| Medical misinformation claims | Strong disclaimers, cite sources, don't diagnose |
| Competitor launches | Move faster, build trust deeper |
