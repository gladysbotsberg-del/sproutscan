## 3 Key Benefits

### 1. 🎯 Instant Answers, Zero Confusion
No more Googling and getting 47 different opinions. Scan any food and get a clear, science-backed answer in under 2 seconds. Green means go. Yellow means check the details. Red means skip it.

### 2. 🔬 Trustworthy, Not Terrifying
Our recommendations come from ACOG, FDA, and leading maternal health guidelines — not random mommy blogs or outdated advice. We explain the *why* behind every rating so you understand the actual risks (which are often smaller than the internet makes them seem).

### 3. 📱 Works Everywhere You Eat
Barcode scanner for grocery shopping. Photo recognition for restaurants. Search for home cooking. BellyCheck goes wherever your cravings take you — even offline.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Scan or Snap
Point your camera at a barcode, or take a photo of any dish. Our AI recognizes thousands of foods, from packaged snacks to restaurant meals.

### Step 2: Get Your Answer
See an instant safety rating with a clear explanation. We'll tell you exactly what to look for (like whether that cheese is pasteurized) and why it matters.

### Step 3: Eat & Enjoy
Save your favorites, build your personal safe-foods list, and spend less time worrying — more time enjoying your pregnancy.

## FAQ

### Is BellyCheck a replacement for my doctor's advice?
Nope! BellyCheck is an information tool based on general guidelines. Every pregnancy is different. For personalized medical advice, always consult your healthcare provider. Think of us as a helpful first step, not the final word.

### Where does your safety information come from?
We compile recommendations from ACOG (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists), the FDA, CDC, and peer-reviewed maternal health research. Our database is reviewed quarterly and updated whenever guidelines change.

### What if a food isn't in your database?
You can submit any food for review, and we'll research it and add it — usually within 48 hours. You can also use our general ingredient search to check individual components of a dish.

### Is my data private?
Absolutely. We don't sell your data. We don't share it with advertisers. We collect only what's necessary to make the app work, and you can delete your data anytime. Full details in our privacy policy.

### Is BellyCheck free?
Yes! Core features are free forever. We offer an optional premium tier with advanced features like meal planning, nutritional tracking, and family sharing — but you'll never hit a paywall just to check if something's safe.
