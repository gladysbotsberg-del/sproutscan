BellyCheck's photo recognition means you can check restaurant dishes too. Just snap a pic of the menu or your plate. Because cravings don't only happen at home. [link]

Fun fact: Most foods "banned" during pregnancy are actually fine with a few precautions. BellyCheck tells you what to look for instead of just saying NO to everything. [link]

Pregnancy brain + food safety Googling = forgetting what you were even trying to eat.

## Reddit Posts

### r/pregnant Post

**Title:** Made an app to stop the "is this safe to eat" Google spiral — would love feedback from this community

**Body:**
Hey everyone! I'm [X weeks] pregnant with my [first/second] and got SO tired of Googling every food and getting completely contradictory answers. So my partner (a developer) and I built BellyCheck — a food scanning app specifically for pregnancy.

You can:
- Scan barcodes at the grocery store
- Take photos of restaurant dishes
- Search any food or ingredient

It gives you a clear safety rating (green/yellow/red) with explanations based on actual medical guidelines (ACOG, FDA, etc.) — not random forum posts from 2009.

It's free to download and I'd genuinely love feedback from this community. What features would make this more useful for you? What foods do you find yourself constantly Googling?

Link in my profile if you want to try it!

(Mods — hope this is okay to post. Happy to remove if not. Just wanted to share something that's helped me and might help others!)

### r/BabyBumps Post

**Title:** Finally found a way to stop anxiety-Googling every food 😅

**Body:**
Anyone else spend way too much time Googling whether [random food] is safe during pregnancy, only to find one article saying it's fine and another acting like you'll immediately harm your baby?

I found this app called BellyCheck that lets you scan foods (barcodes or photos) and get instant safety info based on actual medical guidelines. It even tells you WHY something might need caution — like "this cheese is fine if pasteurized, check the label" instead of just "AVOID ALL SOFT CHEESE."

It's been such a relief to just... get an answer and move on instead of spiraling. Wanted to share in case anyone else has the same food anxiety I did!

(Not affiliated, just a fan. Though I did message them some feature suggestions lol)
