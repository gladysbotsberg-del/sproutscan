## Introduction

BellyCheck ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your information when you use the BellyCheck mobile application ("App").

We understand that information about your pregnancy is deeply personal. We designed BellyCheck with privacy as a core principle — we collect only what we need, we don't sell your data, and we give you control.

## Data Sharing

We share your information only in these limited circumstances:

- **Crash Reporting:** To identify and fix technical issues

All service providers are contractually bound to protect your data and use it only for the purposes we specify.

### Legal Requirements
We may disclose information if required by law, legal process, or government request — but we will notify you when legally permitted.

### Business Transfers
If BellyCheck is acquired or merged, your information may transfer to the new entity. We will notify you and this policy will continue to apply.

### With Your Consent
We may share information for other purposes if you explicitly consent.

## Children's Privacy

BellyCheck is designed for adults (expecting parents and their support networks). We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13 (or 16 in the EEA). If we learn we have collected data from a child, we will delete it promptly.

## International Data Transfers

Your information may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your own, including the United States. We ensure appropriate safeguards through:

- Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by the European Commission
- Data Processing Agreements with all service providers

## California Privacy Rights (CCPA)

California residents have additional rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act:

- **Right to Know:** What personal information we collect and how it's used
- **Right to Delete:** Request deletion of your personal information
- **Right to Opt-Out:** We do not sell personal information, so this right does not apply

To exercise these rights, contact us at privacy@bellycheck.app or call [toll-free number].
